# Data Visualization
**Data visualization** is a very complex field that can be extended as much as desired. Since the goal of this project is to introduce you to different Machine Learning concepts, we will only have to cover a few data visualization tasks. To achieve this, our goal will be to find graphs that allow us to find an answer to these three questions:

- **Which Hogwarts course has a homogeneous score distribution between all four houses?**
- **What are the two features that are similar?**
- **What features are you going to use for your logistic regression?**

To answer each question, we are going to use different graphs, which will be explained below.
