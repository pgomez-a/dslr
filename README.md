In this project DataScience x Logistic Regression, you will continue your exploration of Machine Learning by discovering different tools.

### Data Analysis
Before we start training our model, **we need to study the available data.** This way we can get an idea of the results we hope to achieve and the things we can achieve. This first step is very important in the field of Machine Learning, because if we want to understand what we are doing, we must first understand what we have. Once we understand the tools we have and the data available, we will be much more prepared to implement a Machine Learning model capable of adapting to the data.<br>

For this reason, the first thing we need to do in **dslr** is to create an executable that describes the contents of a given database. This program will obtain the numerical columns of said database and will show different statistical measures related to each column, such as: **count, mean, standard deviation, percentiles, etc.** Thanks to this, we will be able to get an idea of the main objective that we want to achieve, which is to be able to classify each Howard student in their respective houses.<br>
