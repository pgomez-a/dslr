In this project DataScience x Logistic Regression, you will continue your exploration of Machine Learning by discovering different tools.

### Data Analysis
According to **[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_analysis)**: *"**Data analysis is a process of inspecting, cleaning, transforming, and modelling data** with the goal of discovering useful information, informing conclusions, and supporting decision-making."*<br>

Before we start training our model, **we need to study the available data.** This way we can get an idea of the results we hope to achieve and the things we can achieve. This first step is very important in the field of Machine Learning, because if we want to understand what we are doing, we must first understand what we have. Once we understand the tools we have and the data available, we will be much more prepared to implement a Machine Learning model capable of adapting to the data.<br>

For this reason, the first thing we need to do in **dslr** is to create an executable that describes the contents of a given database. This program will obtain the numerical columns of said database and will show different statistical measures related to each column, such as: **count, mean, standard deviation, percentiles, etc.** Thanks to this, we will be able to get an idea of the main objective that we want to achieve, which is to be able to classify each Hogwarts student in their respective houses.<br>

### Data Visualization
According to **[Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Data_and_information_visualization)**: *"**Data visualization is an interdisciplinary field that deals with the graphic representation of data and information.**"*

Another important step that we must take before training our model is to visualize the available data. We have calculated and studied different statistical measures that have provided us with very useful information about the problem we want to solve. But we can get more information just as valuable simply by visualizing the data. Thanks to this we will be able to understand, among other things, **how the data is distributed, the dependency that exists between the variables, etc.**<br>

The second part of **dslr** is to create different executables that show us different graphs related to the data. In this way, we will be more prepared for the third step, when we study the best training algorithm to fit our data. We will be able to make a better decision about this algorithm if we consider the information we have obtained from data analysis and data visualization.<br>
