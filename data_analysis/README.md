# Data Analysis
The different statistical measures that have been used to describe the given dataset are: **count, mean, standard deviation, minimum value, maximum value, and quantiles.** Each of these measures gives us very valuable information about each column. We will be more prepared to study our dataset if we really understand what these values represent.<br>

All the mathematical formulas used to calculate these values have tried to be the same as those used by the **[Pandas library](https://pandas.pydata.org)**. In the case of quantiles, the result may vary by a few decimal places.
