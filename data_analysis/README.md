# Data Analysis
The different statistical measures that have been used to describe the given dataset are: count, mean, standard deviation, minimum value, maximum value, and quantiles. Each of these measures gives us very valuable information about each column. We will be more prepared to study our dataset if we really understand what these values represent.
