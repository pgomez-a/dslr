# Logistic Regression

As we delve into the amazing world of **Machine Learning**, it's a good idea to cover as many algorithms as we can. Understanding different training algorithms will help us when we are in doubt about how to train our model. Therefore, I have implemented the option to select the algorithm that we want to use when training our model. In this way, we can compare the results obtained with the different algorithms used. The different training algorithms that have been implemented are:
